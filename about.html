          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m David. I am a technology and music enthusiast, otaku, full stack web
            developer, musician, nonfluent polyglot. Unafraid of my ability to
            identify an unimportant percentage of vehicles just by the logo or
            sound of it’s exhaust. Driven to analyze objects, ideas, and even
            conversations, heuristically for deeper insight
            into human interaction and web technologies.<br><br>
            Web development crossed my path in middle school, during an era
            when it was uncommon to find personal computers in every household. Many
            hours were spent learning from educational books from the library’s
            technology section. It took dedication, drive, and passion mixed with
            persistence which turned out to be an abstract form of artistic expression.<br><br>
            <i>I am enthusiastic in my voyage through the vast and intricate
              digital universe to find and implement solutions that generate harmony with human
              interactions.</i>

          <h3>2002 - 2005</h3>
          <h6>First step, creation.</h6>
          <p>
            My parents bought our first "home desktop" computer. <br><br>
            With the help of HTML books from the library and promotional AOL
            CD-ROM discs that gave you "free minutes" to connect to the
            internet, I spent all summer determined to teach myself code.
          </p>
          <p>
            For years, my uncle would mail out typed newsletters every 6 months
            to family members living out of state to keep everyone informed of
            reunions and holiday gatherings. With young and abundant creativity, I developed a
            website for the families to read these online and to interact together
            on the site.

          <h3>2005 - 2007</h3>
          <h6>First Promotional.</h6>
          <p>
            I became an active member of a small church band that needed help
            promoting their message and music. With
            determination and creativity, I designed and developed
            my first live promotional website (no longer active) for the band "The Grupo".

          <h3>2017 - 2019</h3>
          <h6>First Move.</h6>
          <p>
            After 10+ years in the workforce, I found my way back to Web
            Development through an internal work position opportunity where I
            was able to assist other learn to code. To no surprise, my
            journey was set and since then I have earned my associates in Web
            Development (2019).

          <h3>2019 - Present</h3>
          <h6>First Career.</h6>
          <p>
            Made the decision and plan to earn a Bachelors in Internet and Web
            Development (2020) from ASU. A few months later, landed my first
            job as a Full Stack Software Engineer for
            <a href="https://www.cyberdive.co" target="_blank"><u>Cyber Dive</u></a>,
            helping parents gain peace of mind with their children using social media.
