          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m David. I am a technology and music enthusiast, otaku, web
            developer, musician, nonfluent polyglot. I have an ability to
            identify an unimportant percentage of vehicles just by the logo or
            sound of it’s exhaust. I am driven to analyze objects, ideas, and
            conversations heuristically for deeper understanding and insight
            into user interactions.<br /><br />
            Web development entered my life during middle school, during an era
            when it was uncommon to find personal computers in every home. I
            spent many hours learning from instructional books in the library’s
            technology section. My dedication, drive, and passion for visual
            creation found a digital outlet and thus magnified into many of my
            other forms of artistic expression.<br /><br />
            I am enthusiastic in my voyage through the vast and intricate
            digital universe to attain solutions that are harmonious with user
            interactions.

          <h3>2002</h3>
          <h6>First step</h6>
          <p>
            My parents bought our first "home desktop" computer. <br /><br />
            With the help of HTML books from the library and promotional AOL
            CD-ROM discs that gave you "free minutes" to connect to the
            internet, I spent all summer determined to teach myself code.

          <h3>2003</h3>
          <h6>First creation</h6>
          <p>
            For years, my uncle would mail out typed newsletters every 6 months
            to family members living out of state to keep everyone informed of
            reunions and holiday gatherings. Using my creativeness, I created a
            website for the family to read these online and to interact together
            on the site.

          <h3>2005</h3>
          <h6>First Promotional</h6>
          <p>
            A small church band that I was actively apart of needed help
            promoting their music and their presence in the area. With
            determination and creativeness under my belt, I designed and created
            my first promotional website on the web for the band "The Grupo".

          <h3>2017</h3>
          <h6>First Career</h6>
          <p>
            Over 10+ years in the workforce, I found my way back to Web
            Development through helping others learn basic coding skills. My
            journey was set and since then I have earned my associates in Web
            Development (2019) and soon a Bachelors in Internet and Web
            Development (2020).
